## 📦 Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap pgo-labs/flipio
brew install --cask flipio
```

> Flipio is ad-hoc signed (the author is not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program). The cask removes macOS's quarantine attribute after install so the app can launch without Gatekeeper warnings. Review the source before installing if that concerns you.

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pgo-labs/flipio.git
   cd flipio
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open Flipio.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run the project (⌘R)

4. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Watch OS events with:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.flipio.app"' --level debug --style compact
```

## 🔒 Privacy

Flipio requires Accessibility permissions to:

- Monitor keyboard events for the Option key tap
- Read selected text for conversion
- Simulate keyboard input for converted text

All text processing happens locally on your device. **No data is sent to external servers.**
