# Flipio

A macOS menu bar app that instantly converts text between keyboard layouts. Perfect for when you accidentally type in the wrong keyboard layout.

## Features

- **Quick Layout Conversion**: Tap the Option key to convert selected text or the last typed word between keyboard layouts
- **Bidirectional**: Automatically detects the layout and converts both ways (e.g., English ↔ Russian)
- **Two Conversion Modes**:
  - **Selection Mode**: Select text and tap Option to convert it
  - **Typed Word Mode**: Just tap Option after typing to convert the last word
- **Multiple Conversions**: Keep tapping Option to toggle back and forth between layouts
- **System Integration**: Works with any macOS application
- **Launch at Login**: Optional auto-start on system startup
- **Lightweight**: Runs quietly in your menu bar
